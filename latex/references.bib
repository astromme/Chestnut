     Scratch is a programming language developed at MIT that provides an appealing graphical environment aimed at introducing programming to 8-16 year olds. Familiar programming constructs like conditionals and loops are present, but are presented in an intuitive manner. The authors hold that the ``computational thinking'' that programming affords is a valuable tool that should be encouraged but is currently lacking. Most children's digital fluency is defined by ``reading'' but not ``writing.'' The article discusses some of the design decisions that went into the language. To make the language appeal to their target, the authors wanted Scratch to be more tinkerable, meaningful, and social. Additionally, we can think of any language as having a ``low floor'' (easy to begin), ``high ceiling'' (ability to become more complex), and ``wide walls'' (support for a diverse range of projects). Scratch appropriately focuses on the low floor and wide walls, arguing that a higher ceiling is outside the scope of a learning language, and if students are interesting in ``raising the ceiling'' they can and should look to more established languages like C or Python. \\ \\

     The article raises some important questions that we need to consider, like what the level of floor, ceiling, and walls are. to be continued
