CS 87 Final Project README
Andrew Stromme & Ryan Carlson

To get our project to run, we have a few simple tasks.
First, run the "startupChestnut.sh" script from the top-level directory

** ./startupChestnut.sh

this will initialize all necessary files and will compile the files. This may
take a while.

==> To run the GUI, do the following:
    ** cd build/gui/
    ** ./chestnut

From this interface (once you've created your graphical program) you can click
on the "Translate" button and then the "Run" button to compile the code.

==> To run just the backend, do the following:
    ** cd build/parser/
    ** ./chestnut_parse < chestnut.in

==> To compile the Thrust code produced by chestnut_parse, do the following:
    ** cd build/chestnut/
    ** ./chestnut_example
